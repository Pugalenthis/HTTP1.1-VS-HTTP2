HTTP 1.1:

     1) Http 1.1 send files (HTML,JS and CSS) one by one from server to client so if one file takes time to load it restricts another files to open.

     2) As we know the file restriction is here it slow down the display speed of content to the user.

     3) Http1.1 request all files over a single TCP connection.

     4) All Http connection compress files for easy transfer,whereas the Http 1.1 uses least compression method.



HTTP 2:
 
     1) http 2 sends whole files at once so there is no possible ways to one file restricts another.

     2) As we know the file restriction is not here it enhance the display speed of content to the user.

     3) Http 2  loads request  a new TCP conection for a every single request.

     4) Http 2 uses advanced compression method to compress.
